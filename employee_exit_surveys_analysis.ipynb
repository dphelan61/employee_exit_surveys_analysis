    "From looking at our graph above, it appears those who are \"Established\" and \"Veterans\" at the company are the ones to most likely leave due to being dissatisfied with the company. Since these folks tend to hold the most knowledge of hte company from being there the longest, the company is losing out on a major pool of talent. The DETE and TAFE should interview these folks that are currently working at their agencies to brainstorm different ways to keep them engaged and wanting to remain at the company longer.\n",
